## Prediction on Wine Quality

Introduction: This project aims to predict the wine quality based on the wine features.

Dataset: White wine quality from Kaggle

Objectives:
- Classify wines into target categories (good/poor)
- Train with machine learning models: KNN, SVM, LDA
- Tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Evaluate models with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Compare their performance

Skills:
- Python: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
- Machine Learning: KNN, SVM, LDA
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
